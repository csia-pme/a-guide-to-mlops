This guide has been written for macOS and Linux operating systems in mind. If you use Windows, you might encounter issues. Please use a decent terminal ([GitBash](https://gitforwindows.org/) for instance) or a Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) for optimal results.

This guide assumes that the steps to be performed are done in a working directory independently of it.

The tools and approach must be adapted to your specific use-case and experiments as well.

## Requirements

- [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) must be installed to follow this guide;
- Standard *nix utilities such as wget, unzip, etc. must be installed.

## Next & Previous steps
